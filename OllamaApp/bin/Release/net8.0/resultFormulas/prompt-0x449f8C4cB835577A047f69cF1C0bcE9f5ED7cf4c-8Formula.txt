Here is a basic implementation of your request:

```csharp
using System;
using BigInteger = Nethereum.Hex.HexTypes.HexBigInteger;

namespace UniswapV2SwapCalculator
{
    public class PnlCalculator
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Calculate the PNL for a swap in ETH.
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="amount0Out">The amount of Token 0 sent out.</param>
        /// <param name="amount1Out">The amount of Token 1 sent out.</param>
        /// <param name="reserve0">The reserve amount of Token 0 in the pool.</param>
        /// <param name="reserve1">The reserve amount of Token 1 in the pool.</param>
        /// <param name="balance0">The balance of Token 0 held by the contract after the swap.</param>
        /// <param name="balance1">The balance of Token 1 held by the contract after the swap.</param>
        /// <param name="fee">The fee for the swap in ETH.</param>
        /// <returns>The PNL in ETH.</returns>
        public decimal CalculatePnl(BigInteger amount0Out, BigInteger amount1Out, BigInteger reserve0, BigInteger reserve1, BigInteger balance0, BigInteger balance1, decimal fee)
        {
            var amount0In = balance0 > reserve0 - amount0Out ? balance0 - (reserve0 - amount0Out) : 0;
            var amount1In = balance1 > reserve1 - amount1Out ? balance1 - (reserve1 - amount1Out) : 0;

            decimal totalInput = (decimal)(amount0In * reserve1 + amount1In * reserve0);
            decimal totalOutput = (decimal)((amount0Out * reserve1 + amount1Out * reserve0));

            // Subtract the fee from the total input to get the net input.
            // If the user sent tokens to themselves, we assume they broke even on fees and do not subtract any additional fee.
            decimal netInput = amount0Out == 0 && amount1Out == 0 ? totalInput : totalInput - fee;

            return netInput - totalOutput;
        }
    }
}
```
This C# code calculates the PNL for a swap in ETH. It assumes that all values are provided in their native units (i.e., Wei for tokens and Ether for ETH). The fee is subtracted from the total input, but only if the user did not send tokens to themselves. If the user sent tokens to themselves, we assume they broke even on fees and do not subtract any additional fee. The PNL is then calculated as the net input minus the total output.
