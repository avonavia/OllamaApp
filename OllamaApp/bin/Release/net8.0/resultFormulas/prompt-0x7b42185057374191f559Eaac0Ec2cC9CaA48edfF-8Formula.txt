Here is the implementation of PNL calculation method in C#. Remember that this is a simplified version of how you would calculate profit and loss (PNL) based on the provided Solidity contract, as it does not include many features and complexities present in the original contract such as gas fees, exchange rates, and multiple token transfers.

```csharp
using System;

public class SwapCalculator
{
    // Assembly info (IMPORTANT)
    [assembly: CLSCompliant(true)]

    /// <summary>
    /// Calculates PNL for a given swap operation.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="amount0Out">The amount of token 0 that the user wants to withdraw.</param>
    /// <param name="amount1Out">The amount of token 1 that the user wants to withdraw.</param>
    /// <param name="reserve0">Current reserve of token 0 in the pool.</param>
    /// <param name="reserve1">Current reserve of token 1 in the pool.</param>
    /// <param name="balance0">Current balance of token 0 in the contract.</param>
    /// <param name="balance1">Current balance of token 1 in the contract.</param>
    /// <returns>PNL for the user in Ether (ETH).</returns>
    public static decimal CalculatePNL(decimal amount0Out, decimal amount1Out, decimal reserve0, decimal reserve1, decimal balance0, decimal balance1)
    {
        // Check if output amounts are valid.
        if (!(amount0Out > 0 || amount1Out > 0)) throw new ArgumentException("INSUFFICIENT_OUTPUT_AMOUNT");
        if (!(amount0Out < reserve0 && amount1Out < reserve1)) throw new ArgumentException("INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY");

        // Calculate input amounts.
        decimal amount0In = balance0 > reserve0 - amount0Out ? balance0 - (reserve0 - amount0Out) : 0;
        decimal amount1In = balance1 > reserve1 - amount1Out ? balance1 - (reserve1 - amount1Out) : 0;

        // Check if input amounts are valid.
        if (!(amount0In > 0 || amount1In > 0)) throw new ArgumentException("INSUFFICIENT_INPUT_AMOUNT");

        // Calculate the PNL (Profit and Loss) for the user. We assume a simple profit model: PNL = In - Out, where 'In' is total value of input tokens, and 'Out' is total value of output tokens. Actual calculation may require more sophisticated models.
        decimal pnl = (amount0In * GetPriceOfToken0()) + (amount1In * GetPriceOfToken1()) - (amount0Out * GetPriceOfToken0()) - (amount1Out * GetPriceOfToken1());
        return pnl;
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Returns the current price of token 0 in Ether (ETH). In a real-world application, this would probably be fetched from an external API.
    /// </summary>
    private static decimal GetPriceOfToken0()
    {
        // For simplicity, let's assume the price is a constant for now.
        return 1M;
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Returns the current price of token 1 in Ether (ETH). In a real-world application, this would probably be fetched from an external API.
    /// </summary>
    private static decimal GetPriceOfToken1()
    {
        // For simplicity, let's assume the price is a constant for now.
        return 2M;
    }
}
