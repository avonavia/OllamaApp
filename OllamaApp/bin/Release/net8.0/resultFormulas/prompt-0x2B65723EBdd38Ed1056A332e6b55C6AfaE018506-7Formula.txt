Here is the C# Formula method for the given Solidity contract method:

```csharp
// Sauron Assembly Info
[assembly: System.Reflection.AssemblyKeyFile("")]

namespace Sauron.Formula.UniswapV2Burn
{
    public class UniswapV2BurnFormula : IFormulaPlugin
    {
        public CalculationResult<BigDecimal?> Formula(TransactionInfo info, IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, decimal>>? tokenPrices = null)
        {
            // Get transaction data from the TransactionInfo object
            BigDecimal balance0 = info.GetTokenBalance(_token0);
            BigDecimal balance1 = info.GetTokenBalance(_token1);
            BigDecimal liquidity = info.GetLiquidity();

            // Calculate total supply before any mint fees are applied
            BigDecimal _totalSupply = info.TotalSupply;

            // Calculate the burned amount of each token
            BigDecimal amount0 = liquidity * balance0 / _totalSupply;
            BigDecimal amount1 = liquidity * balance1 / _totalSupply;

            // If there's any fee on burn, calculate the PNL difference based on reserve changes
            bool feeOn = info.MintFee(_reserve0, _reserve1);
            if (feeOn)
            {
                BigDecimal newReserve0 = balance0 - amount0;
                BigDecimal newReserve1 = balance1 - amount1;
                BigDecimal oldK = _reserve0 * _reserve1;
                BigDecimal newK = newReserve0 * newReserve1;
                if (newK > oldK)
                    return CalculationResult<BigDecimal?>.Success(amount0.Plus(amount1).Negate()); // Negative PNL as user is receiving tokens
            }

            // If no fee on burn or the amount sent to the address is equal to the burned amount, PNL is 0
            return CalculationResult<BigDecimal?>.Success(BigDecimal.Zero);
        }
    }
}
```

Note that this code assumes `_token0`, `_token1`, and `_reserve0`, `_reserve1` are instance fields of the class, which are expected to be initialized correctly. Also, the method `info.GetTokenBalance(address)`, `info.TotalSupply`, `info.MintFee(_, _)`, `info.GetLiquidity()`, and `info.GetReserves()` are assumed to exist in the `TransactionInfo` class as public methods that return the required values.

Additionally, this code calculates PNL only for burn operations where tokens are sent back to the user (i.e., burned), as per your instructions. If there's a fee on burn and it causes an increase in total liquidity locked, this is considered a loss for the user as they're receiving more tokens than they burned, so we return negative PNL. In all other cases, PNL is considered to be 0.
