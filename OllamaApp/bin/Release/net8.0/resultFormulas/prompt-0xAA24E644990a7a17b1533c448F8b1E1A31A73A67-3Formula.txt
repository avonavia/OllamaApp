// This method is not related to the Solidity contract's `transferOwnership` function, as it doesn't perform any operations that would result in PNL changes for users. However, I will provide a basic implementation of how you might handle the ownership transfer within a C# context:

```csharp
public class OwnershipTransferFormula : IOwnershipTransferPlugin
{
    public CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>> Formula(TransactionInfo info)
    {
        // Check if the new owner is not null or zero address
        if (info.InputData.NewOwner != "0x0")
        {
            return new CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>>(new List<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>()
            {
                // No PNL changes occur on ownership transfer in this basic implementation
            });
        }
        else
        {
            return new CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>>($"Error: Invalid owner address provided - {info.InputData.NewOwner}");
        }
    }
}
```

Please note that this is a simplified representation and might not cover all the complexities of real-world ownership transfer operations in a blockchain context. Additionally, it assumes that `TransactionInfo` object contains a property `InputData.NewOwner` which holds the new owner's address as provided by the Solidity contract call to `transferOwnership`.

As mentioned earlier, this method does not result in any PNL changes for users in this basic implementation. The actual impact on PNL would depend on other factors and business logic that is not shown in the provided Solidity code snippet.
