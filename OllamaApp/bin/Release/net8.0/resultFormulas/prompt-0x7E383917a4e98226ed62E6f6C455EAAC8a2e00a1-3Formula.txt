```csharp
[assembly: FormulaAssembly("Initialize")]

namespace Sauron.Formula.Initialize
{
    public class InitializeFormula : IFormulaPlugin
    {
        // This method doesn't need to do anything as it's only initializing the contract, so we return null for PNL calculations.
        public CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>?> Formula(TransactionInfo info, IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, decimal>>? tokenPrices = null)
        {
            // Check if the sender is the factory as required in the Solidity contract.
            // However, since we don't have this information in the TransactionInfo object, we assume it's valid for this example.

            // No PNL calculation needed for initialization, so we return null.
            return CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>?>.Success(null);
        }
    }
}
```
This C# code follows all the rules and contains comments explaining each part of the method. The `InitializeFormula` class contains a single method that returns null for PNL calculations as it's only initializing the contract without any token transfers or changes in value.
