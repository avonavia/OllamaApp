This is a C# implementation of the formula for calculating PNL based on the provided Solidity contract method. The calculation takes into account the sender, recipient, and amount of tokens transferred.

```csharp
[assembly: FormulaAssembly("ERC20_PNL")] // Exact name as in Solidity contract

namespace Sauron.Formula.ERC20_PNL
{
    public class ERC20_PNLFormula : IFormulaPlugin
    {
        public CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>?> Formula(TransactionInfo info,
            IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, decimal>>? tokenPrices = null)
        {
            var result = new Dictionary<string, BigDecimal>();

            foreach (var transfer in info.Transfers)
            {
                // Check if the sender is the same as the contract address or owner and subtract fees
                if ((info.Trade || transfer.FromAddress == info.ContractAddress || transfer.FromAddress == info.OwnerAddress) &&
                    transfer.FromAddress != "0x0" && transfer.ToAddress != "0x0") // Added null address checks as per rules
                {
                    BigDecimal amount = (BigDecimal)(transfer.Amount * tokenPrices?.FirstOrDefault(p => p.Key == transfer.TokenInfo.Symbol).Value ?? 1); // Convert to Eth

                    if (!result.ContainsKey(transfer.FromAddress))
                        result[transfer.FromAddress] = BigDecimal.Zero;

                    // Subtract the amount sent from sender's PNL
                    result[transfer.FromAddress] -= amount + info.Fee;
                }

                if (!result.ContainsKey(transfer.ToAddress))
                    result[transfer.ToAddress] = BigDecimal.Zero;

                // Add the amount received to recipient's PNL
                result[transfer.ToAddress] += (BigDecimal)(transfer.Amount * tokenPrices?.FirstOrDefault(p => p.Key == transfer.TokenInfo.Symbol).Value ?? 1);
            }

            return new CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>?> { Data = result.AsEnumerable() };
        }
    }
}
```
This formula assumes that the `info` object contains all necessary information about the transaction and token prices are provided. It calculates PNL for each user address involved in the transfers by adding received amounts and subtracting sent amounts (including fees). If trading is enabled, the sender's check considers it as valid without being equal to the contract or owner addresses.
