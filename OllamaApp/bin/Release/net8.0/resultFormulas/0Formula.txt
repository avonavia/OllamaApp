This is how you can implement the `swapTokensForExactTokens` method in a C# class:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Numerics;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class UniswapV2Router
{
    // Implement methods and properties as required by your application

    public async Task<BigInteger[]> SwapTokensForExactTokens(BigInteger amountOut, BigInteger amountInMax, string[] path, string to, DateTimeOffset deadline)
    {
        var amounts = UniswapV2Library.GetAmountsIn(amountOut, path);

        if (amounts[0] > amountInMax)
            throw new Exception("UniswapV2Router: EXCESSIVE_INPUT_AMOUNT");

        await TransferHelper.SafeTransferFrom(path[0], GetSenderAddress(), UniswapV2Library.PairFor(path[0], path[1]), amounts[0]);

        return _swap(amounts, path, to);
    }

    // Implement the rest of the methods as required by your application
}
```

In this implementation, I assumed that you have a `UniswapV2Library` class and a `TransferHelper` class with appropriate static methods. You may need to adjust or add more classes/methods based on your project's structure and requirements.

This C# method is asynchronous (returns a Task) because it makes an external call to the blockchain, which can be a time-consuming operation that doesn't block the execution of other tasks in your application.
