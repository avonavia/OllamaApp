Here is a basic formula for calculating PNL in C#. This code assumes that there are two public properties `Reserve0` and `Reserve1` representing reserves of tokens, and `FeePercentage` representing fee percentage taken by the pool.

```csharp
using System;

public class SwapCalculator
{
    // Properties for reserves
    public decimal Reserve0 { get; set; }
    public decimal Reserve1 { get; set; }
    public decimal FeePercentage { get; set; }

    // Method to calculate PNL
    public decimal CalculatePNL(decimal amountIn, bool isToken0)
    {
        if (amountIn <= 0)
            throw new ArgumentException("Amount must be greater than zero");

        decimal amountOut;
        decimal fee;

        // Calculate the output and fee based on which token was swapped in
        if (isToken0)
        {
            amountOut = AmountOut(amountIn, Reserve0, Reserve1);
            fee = amountIn * FeePercentage / 100;
        }
        else
        {
            amountOut = AmountOut(amountIn, Reserve1, Reserve0);
            fee = amountOut * FeePercentage / 100;
        }

        // Calculate PNL. If tokens were sent to the same address as sender, no PNL is calculated
        if (IsSameAddress)
            return 0;
        else
            return amountIn - amountOut - fee;
    }

    // This method calculates how much token1 can be received for a certain amount of token0
    private decimal AmountOut(decimal amountIn, decimal reserveIn, decimal reserveOut)
    {
        return amountIn * reserveOut / (reserveIn + amountIn);
    }
}
```

This code assumes that there is another property `IsSameAddress` to check if the sender's address is the same as the recipient's. Note that this formula does not account for gas costs, as it was not specified how these are calculated in the Solidity contract.
