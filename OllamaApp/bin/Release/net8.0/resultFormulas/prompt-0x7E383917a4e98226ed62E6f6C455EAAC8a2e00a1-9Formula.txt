Here's a possible implementation of the Solidity `skim` method in C#. Please note that I am making some assumptions here about the structure of the `TransactionInfo` class, since you did not provide specific details about it:

```csharp
[assembly: FormulaAssembly("Skim")]
namespace Sauron.Formula.Skim
{
    public class SkimFormula : IFormulaPlugin
    {
        public CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>> Formula(TransactionInfo info,
            IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, decimal>>? tokenPrices = null)
        {
            var result = new Dictionary<string, BigDecimal>();

            // Check if the transaction contains any transfers
            if (info.Transfers == null)
                return CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>>.Success(null);

            // Iterate through each transfer in the transaction
            foreach (var transfer in info.Transfers)
            {
                // If the transfer is a token
                if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(transfer.TokenInfo?.Symbol))
                {
                    var tokenSymbol = transfer.TokenInfo.Symbol;

                    // Subtract the transfer amount from the user's balance for that token
                    if (result.ContainsKey(tokenSymbol))
                        result[tokenSymbol] -= transfer.Amount;
                    else
                        result[tokenSymbol] = -transfer.Amount;
                }
            }

            // Subtract the fee from the user's balance in Eth
            if (result.ContainsKey("ETH"))
                result["ETH"] -= info.Fee;
            else
                result["ETH"] = -info.Fee;

            return CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>>.Success(result);
        }
    }
}
```

This code assumes that the `TransactionInfo` class has a property called `Transfers`, which is an `IEnumerable<Transfer>`. The `Transfer` class should have properties for `TokenInfo` and `Amount`. It also assumes that the `TokenInfo` class has a property called `Symbol`, and that the `TransactionInfo` class has a property called `Fee`.

The code iterates through each transfer in the transaction, subtracting the amount of each token from the user's balance. It then subtracts the fee from the user's Eth balance. Finally, it returns a dictionary containing the user's new balance for each token, as well as their new Eth balance (which includes the fee).
