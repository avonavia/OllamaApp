Here is the requested C# Formula for calculating PNL:

```csharp
using System;

namespace UniswapV2PNLCalculator
{
    public class PNLCalculator
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Calculates Profit and Loss based on the swap operation.
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="amount0Out">Amount of token0 sent to the recipient.</param>
        /// <param name="amount1Out">Amount of token1 sent to the recipient.</param>
        /// <param name="reserve0">Current reserve of token0 in the pool.</param>
        /// <param name="reserve1">Current reserve of token1 in the pool.</param>
        /// <param name="balance0">Balance of token0 in the contract after swap operation.</param>
        /// <param name="balance1">Balance of token1 in the contract after swap operation.</param>
        /// <param name="feePercentage">Fee percentage (in decimal) taken from the swap operation.</param>
        /// <returns>Profit and Loss as a decimal value in Eth.</returns>
        public static decimal CalculatePNL(decimal amount0Out, decimal amount1Out, decimal reserve0, decimal reserve1, decimal balance0, decimal balance1, decimal feePercentage)
        {
            // calculate the initial total value of tokens owned by user
            decimal initialValue = amount0Out * reserve1 / (reserve0 + amount0Out) + amount1Out * reserve0 / (reserve1 + amount1Out);

            // calculate the actual received tokens after fee deduction
            decimal received0 = balance0 < reserve0 - amount0Out ? amount0Out - (reserve0 - balance0) : 0;
            decimal received1 = balance1 < reserve1 - amount1Out ? amount1Out - (reserve1 - balance1) : 0;

            // calculate the value of tokens received after fee deduction
            decimal finalValue = (received0 * (1 - feePercentage)) * reserve1 / (reserve0 + received0) + (received1 * (1 - feePercentage)) * reserve0 / (reserve1 + received1);

            // calculate and return the Profit and Loss
            return finalValue - initialValue;
        }
    }
}
```

This code assumes that `feePercentage` is a decimal value representing the percentage of the swap amount to be taken as a fee. The `CalculatePNL` method calculates the PNL for a user based on the input and output amounts, reserves in the pool, and the balance of tokens in the contract after the swap operation. It first calculates the initial total value of the tokens owned by the user, then computes the actual received tokens after fee deduction, and finally calculates the value of these tokens to determine the final PNL.

As per your instructions, this code does not include any decode functions or convertion operations. All necessary data is assumed to be pre-processed and passed as arguments to the `CalculatePNL` method. Additionally, it returns the PNL as a decimal value in Eth.
