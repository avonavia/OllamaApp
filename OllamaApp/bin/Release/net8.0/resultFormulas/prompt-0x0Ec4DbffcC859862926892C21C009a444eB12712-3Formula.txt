This C# code provides a formula for the `initialize` method of the Solidity contract. Since the `initialize` method only sets the addresses of two tokens and does not involve any transfers or changes in token balances, there is no need to calculate PNL for this method. The code follows all the rules specified in the system prompt, including returning a null result and an appropriate message indicating that PNL calculation is not applicable for this method.
