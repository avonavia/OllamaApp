Using the provided information, I'm assuming that you want to create a C# method for calculating the profit and loss (PNL) based on the given Solidity contract method "_msgData()". However, since the "_msgData()" function only returns the raw data of the message, it doesn't provide enough information to calculate PNL.

Given this situation, I cannot create a direct equivalent C# formula for calculating PNL based on the provided Solidity contract method. I would need more context or additional information about the transaction and token prices to determine how to accurately calculate profit and loss.
