The Solidity function provided is an implementation of the Newton-Raphson method to compute the integer square root of a number. However, since you're asking for a C# equivalent, I will provide a simple implementation using the System.Math library which provides a Sqrt() method that returns a double:

```csharp
// Assembly Info
[assembly: FormulaAssembly("Sqrt")]

namespace Sauron.Formula.Sqrt
{
    public class SqrtFormula : IFormulaPlugin
    {
        // Method to calculate the integer square root of a number
        public CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>?> Formula(TransactionInfo info,
            IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, decimal>>? tokenPrices = null)
        {
            var result = new List<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>();

            // Check if Transfers is not null and has at least one element
            if (info.Transfers != null && info.Transfers.Any())
            {
                foreach (var transfer in info.Transfers)
                {
                    // The amount to calculate the square root of must be a positive number, so check that
                    if (transfer.Amount > 0)
                    {
                        var sqrt = Math.Sqrt((double)transfer.Amount);
                        // Since we're working with integers, take the floor of the square root and convert it to a BigDecimal
                        result.Add(new KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>(transfer.TokenInfo.Symbol, (BigDecimal)Math.Floor(sqrt)));
                    }
                }
            }

            return new CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>?>(result);
        }
    }
}
```

This formula takes the square root of each token amount in a transaction and adds it to a list as a pair with its symbol. Please note that the method only handles positive amounts, as you cannot take the square root of a negative number. Also, since we're working with integers, the result is floored before conversion to a BigDecimal.
