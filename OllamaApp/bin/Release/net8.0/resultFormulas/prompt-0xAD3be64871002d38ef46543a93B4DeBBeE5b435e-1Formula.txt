```
This C# code creates a Formula method for the Solidity `getReserves()` function. It assumes that the reserves are stored in a contract and retrieves them as `BigDecimal` values. It also retrieves the last block timestamp as an `int`. The result is returned as a tuple containing the two reserves and the last block timestamp.
