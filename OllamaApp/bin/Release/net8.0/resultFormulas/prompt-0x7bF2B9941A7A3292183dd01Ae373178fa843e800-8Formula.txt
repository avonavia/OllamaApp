Here is a simple C# method for calculating PNL based on the provided Solidity contract function:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Numerics; // For BigInteger type

public class SwapCalculator
{
    public static decimal CalculatePNL(BigInteger reserve0, BigInteger reserve1, BigInteger amount0Out, BigInteger amount1Out, BigInteger fee)
    {
        // Convert reserves to decimal for calculation
        decimal dReserve0 = (decimal)reserve0;
        decimal dReserve1 = (decimal)reserve1;
        decimal dAmount0Out = (decimal)amount0Out;
        decimal dAmount1Out = (decimal)amount1Out;
        decimal dFee = (decimal)fee;

        // Calculate new reserves after swap
        BigInteger newReserve0 = reserve0 - amount0Out;
        BigInteger newReserve1 = reserve1 - amount1Out;

        // Convert new reserves to decimal for calculation
        decimal dNewReserve0 = (decimal)newReserve0;
        decimal dNewReserve1 = (decimal)newReserve1;

        // Calculate price impact of swap on token0
        decimal priceImpact0 = (dAmount0Out / dReserve0) * (dAmount0Out / (dReserve0 - dAmount0Out));

        // Calculate price impact of swap on token1
        decimal priceImpact1 = (dAmount1Out / dReserve1) * (dAmount1Out / (dReserve1 - dAmount1Out));

        // Total price impact
        decimal totalPriceImpact = priceImpact0 + priceImpact1;

        // Calculate PNL as the difference between tokens in and tokens out, subtracting fees
        decimal pnl = (dAmount0Out / dNewReserve0 * dReserve1) - dAmount1Out - dFee * totalPriceImpact;

        return pnl;
    }
}
```

This C# code calculates the PNL for a swap transaction in a UniswapV2-like contract. It uses BigInteger types to handle large numbers, and decimal types for precise calculations. The method takes the reserves of tokens 0 and 1 before the swap (reserve0 and reserve1), the amounts of tokens 0 and 1 that are swapped out (amount0Out and amount1Out), and the fee associated with the swap (fee).

The method calculates the new reserves after the swap, then calculates the price impact of the swap on each token. The total price impact is the sum of these two values. Finally, the method calculates the PNL as the difference between the value of tokens in and tokens out, subtracting fees based on the total price impact.
