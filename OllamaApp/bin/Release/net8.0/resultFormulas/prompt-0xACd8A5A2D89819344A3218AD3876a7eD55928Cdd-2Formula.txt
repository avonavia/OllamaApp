Here's how you could implement this Solidity method as a C# Formula function:

```csharp
[assembly: FormulaAssembly("_safeTransfer")] // This should exactly match the name of the Solidity contract function

namespace Sauron.Formula._safeTransfer
{
    public class _safeTransferFormula : IFormulaPlugin
    {
        public CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>?> Formula(TransactionInfo info,
            IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, decimal>>? tokenPrices = null)
        {
            var result = new List<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>();

            foreach (var transfer in info.Transfers)
            {
                // Subtract the fee from the amount sent to another address
                if(transfer.To != info.FromAddress)
                    result.Add(new KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>(info.FromAddress, -transfer.Amount - transfer.Fee));

                // Add the amount received to the recipient's account (if they are not the same as the sender)
                if(transfer.To != info.FromAddress)
                    result.Add(new KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>(transfer.To, transfer.Amount));
            }

            return new CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>?>(result);
        }
    }
}
```

This code calculates the PNL for each address involved in the transaction. It assumes that the `Transfers`, `FromAddress`, and `To` properties of the `TransactionInfo` object are populated correctly.

Please note that this is a simplified version and does not include all possible error handling and edge cases. Always consider these when implementing production-grade code.
