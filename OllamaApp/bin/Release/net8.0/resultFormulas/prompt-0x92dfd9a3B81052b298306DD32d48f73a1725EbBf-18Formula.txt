// The provided Solidity function is used to transfer ownership of a contract to a null address, effectively renouncing ownership. Since this action doesn't have any direct impact on user's assets or transactions, it won't affect PNL calculation. Therefore, the equivalent C# method would simply return null or an empty CalculationResult as there is no financial operation involved in the Solidity function.

```csharp
public class RenounceOwnershipFormula : IFormulaPlugin
{
    public CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>?> Formula(TransactionInfo info, IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, decimal>>? tokenPrices = null)
    {
        // As per the Solidity function's behavior, no PNL calculation is required. Hence, return an empty result.
        return new CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>?> { Result = Enumerable.Empty<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>() };
    }
}
```
