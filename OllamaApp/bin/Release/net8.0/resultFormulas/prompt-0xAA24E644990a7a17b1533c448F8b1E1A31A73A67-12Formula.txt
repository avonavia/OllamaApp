I understand that you're asking for a C# method that corresponds to a Solidity contract function `_approve`. However, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding as the provided Solidity function is an internal function used for approving tokens within the contract. It doesn't directly relate to transaction or token transfer which is usually what formula methods in your context deal with.

Given this, I can't provide a direct translation of the `_approve` function into C# as it doesn't seem to align with the typical use case for formulas in your system. If you could provide more context or clarify your needs further, I'd be better equipped to assist you accurately.
