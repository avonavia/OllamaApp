I'm unable to create a PNL calculation formula for this Solidity function as it doesn't involve any transactions or value changes that could be used to calculate profit and loss (PNL). This function is simply updating the state of a variable `swapEnabled` to the boolean value provided in the function argument. As such, there's no transactional data that can be used to calculate PNL.
