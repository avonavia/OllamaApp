// This is an example of how you can implement the addBots method in C#.
   // However, since the addBots function only adds addresses to a list, it doesn't seem to have a direct equivalent PNL calculation formula.
   // Therefore, I will provide a skeleton for a possible formula that might be relevant for your system, such as a formula to calculate the number of bots added in a transaction.
