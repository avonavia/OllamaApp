// This method represents the logic for transferring ownership in a Solidity contract, but it's not possible to directly translate this to a PNL calculation formula. Therefore, I can't provide a direct C# implementation of the given Solidity function within the context of calculating PNL.

// However, as per your request and considering the rules you provided for C# Formula method creation, here is a simplified representation of how such a method might look like:

[assembly: FormulaAssembly("TransferOwnership")]

namespace Sauron.Formula.TransferOwnership
{
    public class TransferOwnershipFormula : IFormulaPlugin
    {
        // This formula will not actually calculate PNL, but it simulates the process of transferring ownership and returns a message indicating whether the operation was successful or not.
        // In a real-world scenario, such operations would likely result in a change in token balances that could be used to calculate PNL, but this specific function does not directly affect token transfers.
        public CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>?> Formula(TransactionInfo info, IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, decimal>>? tokenPrices = null)
        {
            // Assuming the new owner address is stored in TransactionInfo's ToAddress field
            string newOwner = info.ToAddress;

            if (newOwner == "0x0")
            {
                return CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>?>.Error("Invalid new owner address");
            }
            else
            {
                // In a real scenario, this would include the logic for transferring ownership in the smart contract
                // For simplicity, we're just returning a success message here
                return CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>?>.Success(null);
            }
        }
    }
}
