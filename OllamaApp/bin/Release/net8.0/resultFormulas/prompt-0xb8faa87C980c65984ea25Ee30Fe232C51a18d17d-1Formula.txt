// This is a place holder for renounceOwnership function which is not directly related to PNL calculation.
   // As this method doesn't involve any token transfers or other operations that could affect PNL, it isn't necessary to write an equivalent C# formula method.
   // Here's a skeleton of the C# code, but no logic inside as there is none in the Solidity method:

namespace Sauron.Formula.RenounceOwnership
{
    public class RenounceOwnershipFormula : IFormulaPlugin
    {
        public CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>?> Formula(TransactionInfo info,
            IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, decimal>>? tokenPrices = null)
        {
            // As this method doesn't involve any operations that could affect PNL, no logic is needed here.

            return new CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>?>(null);
        }
    }
}
