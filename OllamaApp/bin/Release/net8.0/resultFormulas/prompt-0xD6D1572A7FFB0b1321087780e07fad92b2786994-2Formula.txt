// This is not a direct translation of Solidity to C# as Solidity contracts are designed for Ethereum blockchain and C# is a general-purpose programming language. However, based on the Solidity function provided, here's an equivalent C# method that subtracts two uint256 numbers with error handling:

```csharp
using System;

public class MathOperations
{
    public BigInteger Subtract(BigInteger a, BigInteger b, string errorMessage)
    {
        if (b > a)
            throw new ArgumentException(errorMessage); // This corresponds to the require function in Solidity

        BigInteger c = a - b;
        return c;
    }
}
```
Please note that BigInteger is used instead of uint256 as C# doesn't have an equivalent for Solidity's unsigned integer type. This code assumes that the input errorMessage will be used to create a meaningful exception message if b is greater than a.
