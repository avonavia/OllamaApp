I have created a C# Formula method that calculates PNL based on the Solidity contract method `openTrading`. Please note that this is an estimate because we don't have access to actual transaction data, but it should give you a general idea of how to approach the problem.

```csharp
[assembly: FormulaAssembly("OpenTradingPNLFormula")]

namespace Sauron.Formula.OpenTradingPNLFormula
{
    public class OpenTradingPNLFormula : IFormulaPlugin
    {
        public CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>?> Formula(TransactionInfo info,
            IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, decimal>>? tokenPrices = null)
        {
            // Check if the transaction is from the owner and for the openTrading method
            if (info.FromAddress != info.ToAddress || info.MethodName != "openTrading")
                return new CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>?>(null, 0);

            // Get the balance of the sender before the transaction
            var initialBalance = info.GetInitialBalance();

            // Calculate the amount transferred to the contract (92% of the initial balance)
            var transferredAmount = initialBalance * new BigDecimal(92, 2);

            // Assume that the LP tokens are priced in ETH at the time of calculation
            var lpTokenPrice = tokenPrices?.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Key == "LP_TOKEN").Value ?? 0;

            // Calculate the value of the transferred amount in ETH
            var transferredEthValue = transferredAmount * new BigDecimal((decimal)lpTokenPrice);

            // Calculate PNL (assuming no fee for simplicity, adjust as needed)
            var pnl = -transferredEthValue;

            return new CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>?>(null, (double)pnl);
        }
    }
}
```

This code defines a `OpenTradingPNLFormula` class that implements the `IFormulaPlugin` interface and calculates the PNL based on the Solidity contract method `openTrading`. The calculation assumes that the LP tokens are priced in ETH at the time of calculation. It's also important to note that this is a simplified example, and the actual implementation may require additional considerations and error handling.
