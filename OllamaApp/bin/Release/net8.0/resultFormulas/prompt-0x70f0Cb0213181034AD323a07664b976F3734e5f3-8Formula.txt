Here is the C# formula method for calculating Profit & Loss (PNL) based on the provided Solidity contract method:

```csharp
using System;

public class UniswapV2Calculator
{
    // Assembly information. This is important!
    [System.Reflection.AssemblyVersion("1.0.*")]

    /// <summary>
    /// Calculate PNL for a given swap transaction in Ethereum (ETH)
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="amount0Out">Amount of Token 0 sent</param>
    /// <param name="amount1Out">Amount of Token 1 sent</param>
    /// <param name="reserve0">Reserve amount of Token 0 in the pool</param>
    /// <param name="reserve1">Reserve amount of Token 1 in the pool</param>
    /// <param name="price0">Current price of Token 0 in ETH</param>
    /// <param name="price1">Current price of Token 1 in ETH</param>
    /// <returns>Profit and Loss (PNL) for the user in Ethereum (ETH)</returns>
    public static decimal CalculatePnl(decimal amount0Out, decimal amount1Out, decimal reserve0, decimal reserve1, decimal price0, decimal price1)
    {
        // Check if swap is valid and calculate initial cost of tokens sent out
        if (!(amount0Out > 0 || amount1Out > 0)) throw new Exception("UniswapV2: INSUFFICIENT_OUTPUT_AMOUNT");
        if (!(amount0Out < reserve0 && amount1Out < reserve1)) throw new Exception("UniswapV2: INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY");
        decimal initialCost = (amount0Out * price0) + (amount1Out * price1);

        // Calculate remaining tokens in the pool and their total value after swap
        reserve0 -= amount0Out;
        reserve1 -= amount1Out;
        decimal totalValue = (reserve0 * price0) + (reserve1 * price1);

        // Calculate PNL
        decimal pnl = totalValue - initialCost;

        return pnl;
    }
}
```
This C# code creates a static method in the `UniswapV2Calculator` class called `CalculatePnl`, which takes six parameters: `amount0Out`, `amount1Out`, `reserve0`, `reserve1`, `price0`, and `price1`. It calculates the PNL based on these values, following all the rules outlined in your system prompt. The method throws exceptions if any of the input conditions are not met according to the Solidity contract function.

Please note that this code assumes that the prices for both tokens (`price0` and `price1`) are provided as parameters and are up-to-date. It also does not account for any transaction fees or gas costs. You might need to modify it based on your specific use case and requirements.
