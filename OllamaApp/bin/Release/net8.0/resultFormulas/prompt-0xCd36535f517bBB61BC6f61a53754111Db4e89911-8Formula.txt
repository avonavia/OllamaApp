Here is a possible solution for calculating PNL using C#:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Numerics;

// This is a simple representation of the UniswapV2 swap function in C#.
public class UniswapV2
{
    // Assume that token reserves and sender's balance are stored as BigInteger objects to handle large numbers.
    public BigInteger Reserve0 { get; set; }
    public BigInteger Reserve1 { get; set; }
    public BigInteger BalanceSenderToken0 { get; set; }
    public BigInteger BalanceSenderToken1 { get; set; }

    // Fee percentage in basis points (1/100th of a percent). UniswapV2 takes 0.3% fee by default.
    private const int FeePercentage = 30;

    public BigInteger CalculatePNL(BigInteger amount0Out, BigInteger amount1Out, string toAddress)
    {
        // Check if the output amounts are valid
        if (amount0Out <= 0 && amount1Out <= 0)
            throw new ArgumentException("UniswapV2: INSUFFICIENT_OUTPUT_AMOUNT");

        // Check if there's enough liquidity
        if (amount0Out >= Reserve0 || amount1Out >= Reserve1)
            throw new InvalidOperationException("UniswapV2: INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY");

        // Assume that the tokens were transferred to the recipient, so we subtract them from sender's balance.
        BalanceSenderToken0 -= amount0Out;
        BalanceSenderToken1 -= amount1Out;

        // Calculate how much the contract received in return for the swapped tokens.
        BigInteger amount0In = CalculateAmountIn(amount0Out, Reserve0);
        BigInteger amount1In = CalculateAmountIn(amount1Out, Reserve1);

        if (amount0In <= 0 && amount1In <= 0)
            throw new InvalidOperationException("UniswapV2: INSUFFICIENT_INPUT_AMOUNT");

        // Calculate the value of swapped tokens in Eth before and after fees.
        BigInteger valueBeforeFees = amount0Out * Reserve1 + amount1Out * Reserve0;
        BigInteger valueAfterFees = amount0In * Reserve1 + amount1In * Reserve0;

        // Subtract the fee from the input amounts.
        amount0In -= amount0In * FeePercentage / 10000;
        amount1In -= amount1In * FeePercentage / 10000;

        // Calculate the PNL for the sender based on the difference between the value of input and output tokens.
        BigInteger pnl = (amount0In * Reserve1 + amount1In * Reserve0) - valueBeforeFees;

        // Check if the sender is sending tokens to themselves, in which case the fee is deducted from their PNL.
        if (toAddress == Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SENDER_ADDRESS"))
            pnl -= (valueAfterFees - valueBeforeFees) * FeePercentage / 10000;

        return pnl;
    }

    private BigInteger CalculateAmountIn(BigInteger amountOut, BigInteger reserve)
    {
        // This is a simplified version of UniswapV2's internal _get_amount_in function.
        BigInteger numerator = amountOut * 1000;
        BigInteger denominator = reserve - amountOut;
        return numerator / denominator;
    }
}
```
