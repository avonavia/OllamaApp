Sure! Here is a simple representation of how you might calculate PNL for this Solidity contract's swap method in C#:

```csharp
using System;

public class UniswapV2Calculator
{
    // Calculate Profit and Loss (PNL)
    public decimal CalculatePNL(decimal initialBalance, decimal finalBalance, decimal priceAtSwapTime, bool isToken0, decimal feePercentage = 0.003M)
    {
        // If the user sent tokens to another address or made a swap that didn't result in any token change, calculate the PNL differently
        if (initialBalance != finalBalance && initialBalance > 0)
        {
            decimal amountTraded = initialBalance - finalBalance;
            decimal feePaid = amountTraded * feePercentage;

            // If the user swapped Token0 for Token1, calculate the PNL based on the price of Token0 at swap time.
            if (isToken0)
            {
                return (amountTraded - feePaid) / priceAtSwapTime - amountTraded;
            }
            // If the user swapped Token1 for Token0, calculate the PNL based on the price of Token1 at swap time.
            else
            {
                return amountTraded * priceAtSwapTime - (amountTraded - feePaid);
            }
        }
        // In case of sending tokens to another address or no change in balance, we assume no profit or loss is made.
        else
        {
            return 0;
        }
    }
}
```

This code calculates PNL based on the initial and final token balances, the price at swap time, whether Token0 or Token1 was swapped, and a fee percentage (defaulted to 0.3%). Please note that this is a simplified representation and may need to be adjusted based on your specific requirements and context.
