Here's the C# Formula method to mirror the Solidity contract method `getReserves`:

```csharp
using System.Numerics;
using Sauron.Core.Contracts.Models;
using Sauron.Core.Formula;

[assembly: FormulaAssembly("getReserves")] //This should be EXACTLY as function name in Solidity contract

namespace Sauron.Formula.GetReserves
{
    public class GetReservesFormula : IFormulaPlugin
    {
        public CalculationResult<Tuple<BigInteger, BigInteger, uint>> Formula(TransactionInfo info,
            IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, decimal>>? tokenPrices = null)
        {
            // Assuming that reserve0 and reserve1 are stored in the DecodedData dictionary of TransactionInfo object
            var reserve0 = (BigInteger)info.DecodedData["reserve0"];
            var reserve1 = (BigInteger)info.DecodedData["reserve1"];
            var blockTimestampLast = (uint)info.DecodedData["blockTimestampLast"];

            return new CalculationResult<Tuple<BigInteger, BigInteger, uint>>
                { Result = Tuple.Create(reserve0, reserve1, blockTimestampLast), ErrorMessage = null };
        }
    }
}
```

This code is a C# implementation of the `getReserves` function from a Solidity contract. It retrieves data stored in the TransactionInfo object (which is assumed to have been decoded beforehand) and returns it as a Tuple. The formula method always follows a specific structure and adheres to certain rules, such as calculating results without user messages, returning the correct PNL type, not trying to decode any data, and subtracting fees if necessary.
