Here is the C# Formula method for calculating PNL based on the provided Solidity contract:

```csharp
using System;

public class UniswapV2PNLCalculator
{
    public static decimal CalculatePNL(decimal reserve0, decimal reserve1, decimal amount0Out, decimal amount1Out, decimal feePercent)
    {
        // Check if input amounts are valid
        if (amount0Out <= 0 && amount1Out <= 0) throw new ArgumentException("Insufficient output amount");
        if (amount0Out >= reserve0 || amount1Out >= reserve1) throw new ArgumentException("Insufficient liquidity");

        // Calculate the input amounts based on the remaining reserves after swap
        decimal amount0In = reserve0 > amount0Out ? reserve0 - amount0Out : 0;
        decimal amount1In = reserve1 > amount1Out ? reserve1 - amount1Out : 0;

        if (amount0In <= 0 && amount1In <= 0) throw new ArgumentException("Insufficient input amount");

        // Calculate the fees paid
        decimal feePaid0 = amount0In * feePercent / 100;
        decimal feePaid1 = amount1In * feePercent / 100;

        // Calculate PNL by subtracting fees from swapped out amounts and adding swapped in amounts
        decimal pnl = (amount0Out - feePaid0) + (amount1Out - feePaid1);

        return pnl;
    }
}
```

This formula assumes that the fee is a percentage of the input amount. The `CalculatePNL` method takes in the current reserves and the amounts swapped out, along with the fee percentage as parameters, and returns the profit or loss (in Eth) for the user.
