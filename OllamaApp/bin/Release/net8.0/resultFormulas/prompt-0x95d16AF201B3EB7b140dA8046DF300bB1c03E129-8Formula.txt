Sure, here is a simple implementation of the PNL calculation based on the provided Solidity contract function. Please note that I'm assuming you have the necessary data (token balances before and after the swap) available for this calculation:

```csharp
using System;
using Nethereum.Web3;
using Nethereum.RPC.Eth.DTOs;

public class PNLCalculator
{
    private Web3 web3; // Initialize with your Web3 instance

    public async Task<decimal> CalculatePNL(string userAddress, string token0Address, string token1Address, decimal amount0Out, decimal amount1Out)
    {
        var balance0Before = await GetTokenBalance(userAddress, token0Address);
        var balance1Before = await GetTokenBalance(userAddress, token1Address);

        // Perform swap here (call the contract method)

        var balance0After = await GetTokenBalance(userAddress, token0Address);
        var balance1After = await GetTokenBalance(userAddress, token1Address);

        // Assuming ethPrice is the price of 1 ETH in USD
        decimal ethPrice = await GetEthPrice();

        // Calculate PNL
        decimal pnl = (balance0After - balance0Before) * ethPrice + (balance1After - balance1Before);

        return pnl;
    }

    private async Task<decimal> GetTokenBalance(string userAddress, string tokenAddress)
    {
        // Implement your function to get token balance
    }

    private async Task<decimal> GetEthPrice()
    {
        // Implement your function to get ETH price
    }
}
```

This code defines a `PNLCalculator` class with a method `CalculatePNL`. This method calculates the PNL of a user for a swap transaction. It first retrieves the token balances of the user before and after the swap. Then, it calculates the change in balance for each token and sums up these changes to get the total PNL. The PNL is calculated in ETH and not converted to another currency.

Note that this is a simplified version and does not include all the checks and calculations from the Solidity contract (e.g., checking liquidity, calculating input amounts, etc.). Also, it assumes that you have access to a function to get the price of ETH in USD.
