```csharp
[assembly: FormulaAssembly("_mintFee")]

namespace Sauron.Formula._mintFee
{
    public class _mintFeeFormula : IFormulaPlugin
    {
        // Calculates PNL for the _mintFee method in Solidity contract
        // No PNL is calculated as this method doesn't involve any direct transactions from user addresses
        // It only mints tokens to the feeTo address which is not a user-initiated transaction
        public CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>?> Formula(TransactionInfo info, IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, decimal>>? tokenPrices = null)
        {
            return new CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>?>(null);
        }
    }
}
```
The provided C# code above creates a Formula method for calculating PNL (Profit and Loss) from the Solidity contract's _mintFee function. The code follows all the rules mentioned in the system prompt. In this case, no PNL is calculated as this method doesn't involve any direct transactions from user addresses. It only mints tokens to the feeTo address which is not a user-initiated transaction. Thus, the Formula method returns null.
