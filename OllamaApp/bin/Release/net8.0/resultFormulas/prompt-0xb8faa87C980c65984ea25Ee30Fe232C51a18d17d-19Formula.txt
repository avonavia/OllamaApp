//Method for calculating PNL based on the Solidity contract method _approve
   //Please note that this method does not directly calculate profit and loss as it's just an approval process, but following the rules provided:

[assembly: FormulaAssembly("_approve")]
namespace Sauron.Formula._approve
public class _approveFormula : IFormulaPlugin
{
    public CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>?> Formula(TransactionInfo info,
        IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, decimal>>? tokenPrices = null)
    {
        //No PNL is calculated during the approval process.
        return new CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>?>(null);
    }
}
