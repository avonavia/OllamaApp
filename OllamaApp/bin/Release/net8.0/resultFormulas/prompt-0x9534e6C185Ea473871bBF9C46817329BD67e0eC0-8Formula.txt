        decimal adjustedAmount0Out = amount0Out - (totalFees / price0);
        decimal adjustedAmount1Out = amount1Out - (totalFees / price1);

        // Calculate the value of adjusted tokens swapped out.
        decimal totalValueOutAfterFee = (adjustedAmount0Out * price0) + (adjustedAmount1Out * price1);

}
```
In this example, the `CalculatePNL` method takes in the amount of token0 and token1 that are swapped out, their prices in Eth, and the fee percentage for the swap. It calculates the PNL by first determining the total value of tokens swapped out, then adjusting that value to account for fees, and finally subtracting the adjusted total value from the original total value. The result is returned as a decimal representing the PNL in Eth.
