Here is the C# Formula method for the Solidity contract method:

```csharp
[assembly: FormulaAssembly("UniswapV2")]

namespace Sauron.Formula.UniswapV2
{
    public class UniswapV2Formula : IFormulaPlugin
    {
        // Calculate PNL based on the _update function in Solidity contract
        public CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>?> Formula(TransactionInfo info,
            IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, decimal>>? tokenPrices = null)
        {
            // Assume balance0 and balance1 are the initial balances of tokens 0 and 1 respectively
            var balance0 = new BigDecimal((decimal)info.FromTokenBalance);
            var balance1 = new BigDecimal((decimal)info.ToTokenBalance);

            // Calculate current reserves based on the updated balances, as they are equal to the new balances
            var reserve0 = new BigDecimal(balance0);
            var reserve1 = new BigDecimal(balance1);

            // Initialize PNL with zero
            var pnl = BigDecimal.Zero;

            // If this is not a first swap and reserves are not zero, calculate PNL based on the price change
            if (info.PreviousReserve0 != 0 && info.PreviousReserve1 != 0)
            {
                var reserveRatioChange = (reserve1 / info.PreviousReserve1) - (reserve0 / info.PreviousReserve0);
                pnl += reserveRatioChange * balance0; // Assuming fromAddress swapped token0 to token1
            }

            // Deduct fee if it exists and is not sent to the user's own address
            var fee = new BigDecimal((decimal)info.Fee);
            if (fee > 0 && info.ToAddress != info.FromAddress)
                pnl -= fee;

            // Return PNL for both fromAddress and toAddress as KeyValuePair with their corresponding addresses
            var result = new List<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>()
            {
                new KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>(info.FromAddress, -pnl),
                new KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>(info.ToAddress, pnl)
            };

            return new CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>?>(result);
        }
    }
}
```

This method calculates the PNL based on the price change and subtracts any fees that were paid to addresses other than the sender's address. The method assumes that `info.FromTokenBalance` is the initial balance of token0, `info.ToTokenBalance` is the initial balance of token1, `info.PreviousReserve0` is the previous reserve of token0, `info.PreviousReserve1` is the previous reserve of token1, `info.Fee` is the fee paid for this transaction, `info.FromAddress` is the sender's address, and `info.ToAddress` is the recipient's address. The method returns a list of KeyValuePairs with addresses and their corresponding PNL values.
