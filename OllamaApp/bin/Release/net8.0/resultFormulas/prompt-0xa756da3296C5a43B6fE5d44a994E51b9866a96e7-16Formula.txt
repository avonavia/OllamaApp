// Since the provided Solidity method 'delBots' is not related to calculating PNL (Profit and Loss), it's not possible to directly convert this function into a C# formula for PNL calculation.

    // However, I can provide a simplified representation of how you might manage a similar operation in a C# context. In this case, let's assume that we have a list of 'bots' (represented by addresses) and the method 'DelBots' is used to remove certain bots from this list based on their addresses:

    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using Sauron.Formula;

    [assembly: FormulaAssembly("RemoveBots")]

    namespace Sauron.Formula.RemoveBots
    {
        public class RemoveBotsFormula : IFormulaPlugin
        {
            // This method simulates the 'delBots' operation by removing specified addresses from a list of bots.
            // Since PNL calculation is not involved in this operation, the method returns void as per your rules.
            public CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>?> Formula(TransactionInfo info, IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, decimal>>? tokenPrices = null)
            {
                // Assuming that 'info' contains the necessary data for this operation.
                var notBotAddresses = info.NotBotAddresses; // This might be a list of addresses obtained from the transaction data.

                // Simulating removal of bots by setting their status to false in a dictionary.
                var bots = new Dictionary<string, bool>(); // Replace this with your actual bot management structure.
                foreach (var address in notBotAddresses)
                    if (bots.ContainsKey(address))
                        bots[address] = false;

                // Since PNL calculation is not the purpose of this operation, return null as per your rules.
                return CalculationResult<IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, BigDecimal>>?>.Successful(null);
            }
        }
    }
