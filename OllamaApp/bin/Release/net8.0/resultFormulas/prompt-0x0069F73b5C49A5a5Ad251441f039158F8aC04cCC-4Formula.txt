Here is a sample implementation of the `transferFrom` method in C#:

```csharp
public bool TransferFrom(string sender, string recipient, uint amount)
{
    _Transfer(sender, recipient, amount);
    Approve(sender, Blockchain.Transaction.Sender, Allowances[sender][Blockchain.Transaction.Sender] - amount);
    return true;
}
```

This method is assumed to be a part of an ERC20 token contract-like class in C# for a blockchain platform that supports smart contracts similar to Ethereum and Solidity. It takes three parameters: `sender`, `recipient`, and `amount`. The `_Transfer` function performs the transfer operation, and the `Approve` function updates the allowance of the sender to the msgSender (the address who calls this method).

Please replace the `_Transfer` and `Approve` methods with the appropriate implementations that fit your project's requirements. Also note that this C# code does not include any overflow or underflow checks, as it is assumed that the underlying blockchain platform provides these guarantees like Solidity 0.8.

Also remember to validate inputs and handle exceptions appropriately in a production-level application.
